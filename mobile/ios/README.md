# iOS platform folder

This tree was authored without the Flutter SDK on PATH, so the Xcode
project is not generated here.

From the parent `mobile/` directory:

    flutter create --org com.azieeliab --project-name zionpattern .

That fills `ios/` (and `android/`) with the platform projects.

Then:

    flutter pub get
    flutter run

Or open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
Offline. No analytics. Bundle id: `com.azieeliab.zionpattern`.
